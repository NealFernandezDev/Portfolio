              My first experience with programming was my mid teens (34 now) when there
              was a website that allowed us to create and design our own page/guest book where friends 
              or anyone can write on. A couple of friends and I 
              built pages for people as well as various groups. But that ended once other different 
              types of social media outlets came out (myspace, facebook etc.)

              My current focus with my coding journey is to find a company I can learn and hopefully grow with through 
              an internship. What I enjoy most with coding is putting together a concept a designer 
              has built and then making it a working reality for 
              others. To me coding is like a puzzle but instead functions, variables, components, and various others are the pieces.

              When I am not working on a project, I'm usually playing video games, working out,
              watching movies, playings some sports, walking my dog or biking if the weather permits.
