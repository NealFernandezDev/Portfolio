              My first experience with programming was my mid teens (34 now) when there
              was a website that allowed us to create our own page that also had 
              a guest book where friends or anyone can write on. I helped 
              build pages for people as well as groups. But that ended once other different 
              types of social media outlets came out (myspace, facebook etc.)

              My main focus with my coding journey is to find a company I can learn and hopefully grow with.
              What I enjoy most with coding currently is putting together a website a designer 
              has built (I am terrible at designing) and then making it a working reality for 
              others. To me it's like a puzzle.

              When I am not working on a project, I'm usually playing video games, working out,
              watching movies, playings some sports, walking my dog or biking if the weather permits.
