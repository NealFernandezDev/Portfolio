              My first experience with programming was my mid teens (34 now) when there<br/>
              was a website that allowed us to create our own page that also had <br/>
              a guest book where friends or anyone can write on. I helped <br/>
              build pages for people as well as groups. But that ended once other different <br/>
              types of social media outlets came out (myspace, facebook etc.)<br/>
              <br/>
              My main focus with my coding journey is to find a company I can learn and hopefully grow with.<br/>
              What I enjoy most with coding currently is putting together a website a designer <br/>
              has built (I am terrible at designing) and then making it a working reality for <br/>
              others. To me it's like a puzzle.<br/>
              <br/>
              When I am not working on a project, I'm usually playing video games, working out, <br/>
              watching movies, playings some sports, walking my dog or biking if the weather permits.
